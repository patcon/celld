# Cloudflare compatibility

celld implements the Cloudflare Workers APIs that this page links to. Read the
Cloudflare documentation for the standard behavior of each API.

This page lists only an unavailable feature, a celld-specific limit, or an
observable difference. If an entry has no note, celld intends to match the
linked Cloudflare API.

- **Yes** means that celld implements the API, except for the listed differences.
- **Partial** means that a substantial part of the API is unavailable.
- **Experimental** means that celld can change the API without notice.
- **No** means that celld does not implement the API.

celld must reject an unsupported configuration or API at deployment or first
use. An unsupported feature that does not cause an error is a defect.

## Services

from Cloudflare.

### [Fetch, Request, Response, and Headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/)

- The `cache` request option is unavailable.
- An inbound `Request` has a `cf` object without Cloudflare edge fields. celld
  cannot prove the geolocation, colo, or TLS metadata.
- celld removes `Content-Length` from a Worker response, except for a `HEAD`
  response.
- A remote Durable Object call cannot retry after request-body transmission
  starts because celld keeps no replay copy.
- A remote Durable Object call waits for a rejected owner generation to change
  for at most `CELLD_OPERATION_DEADLINE_MS`.

### [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)

The [services table](#services) lists the available binding types. Each binding
type that the table does not list is unavailable.

### [Context](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/)

- `passThroughOnException()` has no effect because celld has no CDN fallback.
- `ctx.facets` is available only inside a Durable Object.

### [Handlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/)

The `tail` and `email` handlers are unavailable.

### [RPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/)

- An RPC stub cannot cross an isolate boundary.
- An `AbortSignal` in a Durable Object RPC call does not cross a node boundary.
- A remote RPC retries only when the failed peer attempt did not start the
  method. Use a stable operation ID for an application retry.

### [Streams](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/streams/)

- celld expires an unclaimed and inactive HTTP stream after 60 seconds. A
  successful stream operation starts a new 60-second period.
- An expired or unknown stream reports an error instead of EOF.

### [WebSockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/websockets/)

- An outbound Worker socket closes when its event and `waitUntil` work end. A
  socket returned in the response stays open.
- Each isolate-polled input queue has a 1 MiB budget for non-terminal frames. A
  message larger than 1 MiB uses the complete budget.
- If the isolate stops polling, celld discards unread frames during cleanup. A
  later pull reports an abnormal close.
- A WebSocket transport cannot move to a new cell owner. A client must reconnect
  with the same application operation ID.
- A tunneled connection forwards the owner's Close without an additional Close.
  If the owner connection fails between frames before a Close, the ingress sends
  code 1012. If a frame is incomplete, the ingress closes the transport instead.
- `acceptWebSocket()` throws above 90 percent of the V8 heap limit.

### [Web Crypto](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/)

- HMAC accepts MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.
- ECDSA supports only the P-256 curve with SHA-256.
- AES-GCM accepts authentication tags from 96 through 128 bits in 8-bit steps.
- RSA-OAEP accepts SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. A nonempty label must
  contain valid UTF-8.
- A secret key cannot use `jwk` with `exportKey()` or `wrapKey()`.

### [Web standards](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-standards/)

### [Performance and timers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/performance/)

`performance.timeOrigin` is `0`, and `performance.now()` matches `Date.now()`.
Both clocks advance at an I/O boundary and stay fixed during JavaScript
execution.

### [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/)

- celld implements `node:assert`, `node:async_hooks`, `node:buffer`,
  `node:diagnostics_channel`, `node:events`, `node:fs`, `node:os`, `node:path`,
  `node:stream`, `node:timers/promises`, and `node:util`.
- `node:diagnostics_channel` does not export messages to a tail Worker.
- `node:crypto` does not implement Diffie-Hellman, streaming signatures,
  ciphers, RSA-PSS, or DSA signatures and key generation.
- `KeyObject.toCryptoKey()` applies the requested algorithm, extractability,
  and usages to an asymmetric key.
- `node:zlib` implements only the synchronous gzip and deflate functions.
- `node:fs` provides `access`, `mkdir`, `realpath`, `stat`, `lstat`, and
  `readFile`. It exposes an empty, request-local `/tmp` and a read-only
  `/bundle` that contains the Worker modules.
- The global `process` gives each field that it defines the same value that
  workerd gives it, so a dependency that reads `process.execPath`,
  `process.argv`, or `process.title` at module scope can load. celld does not
  define the full workerd surface, so a field such as `process.kill` or
  `process.features` is undefined.
- The celld bundler supports a synchronous CommonJS `require()` of a Node.js
  built-in module. A raw ESM Worker has no global `require()`.
- A Node.js built-in module object is writable, so a CommonJS dependency that
  replaces a function on the module at load can start. The `graceful-fs`
  package replaces `fs.close` this way. A patch stays in the isolate that
  applies it, therefore another Worker never observes the patch.
- An import of another Node.js module succeeds, but its first call throws an
  error.

### [Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/)

celld provides an always-miss cache because it has no shared edge cache.
`put()` validates and consumes a response but stores nothing, `match()` returns
`undefined`, and `delete()` returns `false`.

### [TCP sockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/)

- A socket cannot outlive its event. A Durable Object must reconnect during a
  later event.
- celld verifies a TLS server against its bundled Mozilla root store.
- celld does not block the destination ports that Cloudflare blocks. The fleet
  network controls the egress policy.

### BroadcastChannel

celld defines the class so that a bundle can load, but its constructor throws an
error.

## Compatibility flags

celld honors these compatibility switches:

- `delete_all_deletes_alarm`
- `js_rpc`
- `fetcher_no_get_put_delete`
- `sqlite_vec`
- `websocket_standard_binary_type`
- The static-assets navigation flags

celld accepts each other compatibility flag without effect.
`Cloudflare.compatibilityFlags` reports only the flags that celld honors.

## Wrangler configuration

`celld deploy` accepts `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.json`. It does not accept
`wrangler.toml`.

The `name` value must contain 1 to 63 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, or
internal hyphens. It cannot start or end with a hyphen.

The deployment accepts these top-level keys:

- `$schema`, `name`, `main`, and `no_bundle`
- `compatibility_date` and `compatibility_flags`
- `durable_objects` and `migrations`
- `assets`, `services`, `triggers`, and `vars`
- `d1_databases`, `kv_namespaces`, `queues`, `workflows`, and
  `r2_buckets`
- `worker_loaders` and `containers`
- `define` and `rules`

Each other top-level key, including `routes`, stops the deployment.

`celld deploy` bundles with esbuild, and it gives `define` and `rules` to that
run. Each `define` value is a JavaScript expression, as it is for Wrangler.
A rule must have a `type` of `Text`, `Data`, or `CompiledWasm`, and each of its
globs must have the form `**/*.ext` or `*.ext`: esbuild selects a loader by
file extension, so celld refuses a glob that selects a different set of files.

Two rules can name one extension only if they give it the same type. Two rules
that give one extension different types stop the deployment, because no single
loader satisfies both. celld applies a `CompiledWasm` rule to `**/*.wasm`
already, so a `CompiledWasm` rule for that extension agrees with the built-in
rule and the deployment continues. Another type for `**/*.wasm` stops the
deployment.

`no_bundle` does not run esbuild. A config that sets `no_bundle` with `define`
or `rules` therefore stops the deployment.

An asset-only project can omit `main`. The native deploy command refuses an
unsafe asset path, and `.assetsignore` requires Wrangler.

See [Limitations](limitations.md) for the operating-system, networking,
security, pressure, and update boundaries.
